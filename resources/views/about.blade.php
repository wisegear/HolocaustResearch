        <p>I was never the most attentive in school, I left in 1988 with virtually no qualifications. But whilst there it took only a single lesson in history class to catch
            my attention. It was on the holocaust. "Seems unlikely" was my first thought on contemplating that the Germans had killed a suggested 6m people. Especially when 
            they had done this pretty much in plain sight whilst also fighting a world war and nobody knew or they would surely have done something about it?
        </p>

        <p>And there it began. A lifelong interest in learning more about the Holocaust.</p>

        <p>By the late 90's I built a website on the holocaust, it was a simple site using basic HTML pages and I just kept adding more and more content to it. Anyone who 
            understands websites will know that using only HTML and having hundreds of pages was always going to end badly. And it did!</p>

        <p>After many years I stopped adding content, I was no longer able to control the content or change things in an easy way. Adding a new menu item meant updating hundreds
             of pages. So it eventually fell into a state of disrepair and needed a complete rebuild.</p>

        <p>Then life events happened, wife, children, mortgage payments and so on. I never lost my interest in the subject though. Whether sitting in the garden or lying on 
            a beach on holiday there was always a book related to the Holocaust nearby.</p>

        <p>More than 20 years after I created that first website I am back with this new one. With more time available I wanted to try again. 
            I have had to learn new programming languages, threatening to quit many times in the past few months but ultimately got there.</p>

        <p>This site is a personal one, transferring all of the information on that site from 20 years ago and adding more. Very much a personal site, 
            I am not a well educated or confident person when it comes to writing so you may or may not appreciate what the site has to offer, but I tried!</p>
